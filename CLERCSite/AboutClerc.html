      The Canadian Lions Eyeglass Recycling Centre (CLERC) is a non-profit
      organization affiliated with Lions Clubs International. CLERC's primary
      objective is to collect, sort, and recycle used eyeglasses. Through their
      efforts, CLERC aims to provide affordable eyewear to individuals in need,
      both in Canada and in developing countries. They collect donated
      eyeglasses from individuals, eye care professionals, and organizations,
      carefully sort them based on prescription and condition, and distribute
      them to partner organizations for redistribution. By recycling and
      repurposing used eyeglasses, CLERC contributes to improving vision and
      quality of life for those who lack access to proper eyewear. CLERC's work
      is vital in addressing the global issue of vision impairment, particularly
      among underserved communities. By collecting and recycling used
      eyeglasses, CLERC helps bridge the gap between the demand for eyewear and
      the lack of access to affordable options. Their efforts not only benefit
      individuals who require corrective lenses but also contribute to reducing
      waste and promoting sustainability. CLERC's collaboration with Lions Clubs
      and other partner organizations ensures that the recycled eyeglasses reach
      those who need them the most, making a tangible difference in people's
      lives. The success of CLERC relies on the dedication and commitment of
      their volunteers and the support of Lions Clubs and other stakeholders.
      Through their collective efforts, CLERC strives to create a positive
      impact by improving vision health and promoting access to eyewear for
      individuals who would otherwise face challenges due to financial
      constraints. By focusing on recycling and redistribution, CLERC's work
      exemplifies the power of community-driven initiatives in addressing
      critical healthcare needs and fostering inclusivity in vision care
